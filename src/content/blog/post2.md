### Human-Centered AI Systems

I have taken courses in user interfaces, human-centered design, and cognitive psychology, and I am currently diving into more research regarding UX design.

Though I am someone that focuses more on machine learning, web development, and data security and privacy, I find it particularly important and rewarding to design AI-enabled systems that:

* Augment human abilities rather than displace them
* Account for human behavior, cognition, and limitations
* Foster feelings of empowerment and self-control
* Make complex systems understandable and transparent for end users


### Secure, Private Data Science

I have taken courses in machine learning, network security, data privacy, and cryptography. Consequently, I have developed an understanding of the opportunities and risks when it comes to large scale data science and machine learning. In practice, this includes:

* Selecting, training, and evaluating models across various domains such as statistical learning to natural language processing
* Applying modern techniques for secure data transfer, storage, and processing while respecting user privacy and threat models


### Software Development

Across internships in both startup and highly regulated environments, I have gained experience working at different scales and levels of visibility. I am motivated to grow as a software developer and hone my skills, even during my free time when I work on side projects. Most importantly, I have developed:

* Strong communication and documentation practices, shaped by experience working with stakeholders across multiple teams
* A deep appreciation for good design across all faucets of software development, everything from APIs to databases.
