Although the entire book was full of useful information that will help me become a better UX designer, there were two quotes that stood out to me the most:\n“Humans are strongest exactly where computers are weak, creating a potentially beautiful partnership”\n“Our technologies may change, but the fundamental principles of interaction are permanent”\nHumans are creative, exploratory, and social beings. Those traits, unfortunately, make precise, dull tasks difficult for humans to perform. Thankfully, computers (up until now) are exactly that and performs such tasks with zero issue - a great partnership!\nHowever, with the rise of modern AI technologies, computers have become more “human”. They are no longer the precise, dull machines they once were, and people have begun replacing other people with them.
