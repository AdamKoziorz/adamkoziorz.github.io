UX Design
I have taken courses in user interfaces, human-centered design, and cognitive psychology. Right now, I am currently diving into more research regarding UX design.
As an aspiring UX designer, I find it particularly important and rewarding to:

Design with human behaviour and limitations in mind
Foster feelings of empowerment and self-control
Make complex systems understandable and transparent for end users

Human-Centered AI Systems
I will soon be taking courses in machine learning and ethics with the goal of being able to understand both the implementation and implications of modern AI technologies.">
