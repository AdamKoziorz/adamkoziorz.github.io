### Focus of Studies

I am an aspiring UX designer that wishes to specialize in the harmonious and responsible design of AI and big data solutions. By the time I graduate, I would have taken key courses in HCI as well as gained knowledge in machine learning, data protection, distributed systems, and ethics.

In addition to my courses, I have also gained experience as a project manager, data scientist, and front-end developer through co-op and self-learning.

I anticipate to complete my BCS with an HCI specialization in 2026, and wish to eventually be employed as a UX designer for an AI or data focused company.



### Hobbies

Music is a significant part of my life. I mainly focus on exploring electronic music, but I also enjoy instrumental pieces and have composed some myself.

Here is a small taste of what I enjoy:

In addition to music, I also really enjoy rollerblading, basketball, and board games!
