Privacy, Cryptography, Network, and Data Security <br>
_University of Waterloo_


<b class="h3notoc"> Course Description </b>

Introduction to privacy and security using cryptography and related techniques in networks, distributed systems, and data science. The course examines how data and metadata can be protected at rest, in transit, and during computation. For at-rest protection, specific topics include the basics of cryptography and relevant ethics/policy concepts. For in-transit protection, specific topics include network defenses, authentication, and secure and anonymous communication protocols. For during-computation protection, specific topics include data inference, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, multi-party computations, and related protocols.

{{< notice note "General Disclaimers" >}}
- I am not responsible for any inaccuracies present in these notes.
- I will comply with any requests from UWaterloo to take these notes down.
- These notes are intended to supplement course materials rather than replace them. Official course materials can be found on its own [course site](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/courses/data-sp/F24/schedule.html), anyway.
- I tend to write rough notes throughout the term and then clean them up prior to each in-person assessment. I will try my best to finalize notes by those times.

{{< notice tip "Complementary Courses" >}}
- I am taking multiple courses alongside CS459 that are related to privacy
- For more in-depth information on how data is secured using cryptography, check out my [CO487 course notes](../co487)!
- For a discussion on the social implications of computing, especially concerning survelliance, check out my [CS492 course notes](../cs492)!
