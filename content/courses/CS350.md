## Introduction

### Motivation
How do multiple programs run at the same time and utilize computer resources? The "middle man" responsible for this is the Operating System (OS). This is a maturing field and many different computer science topics are OS issues (high-performance servers, resource consumption, security, databases, game engines, etc.)

We will learn the basics of operating systems, what they do, what issues they can face, and how they affect software. Some key concepts include multi-programming, concurrency, memory management, device management, and file systems. We will focus on these concepts with an emphasis on security and protection.


### What is an Operating System?

The operating system (OS) is a layer between applications and hardware that provides an abstraction to the hardware details, allowing programmers to interact with hardware securely and effectively.

Originally, they were just a library of standard services that didn't really offer any security and the system could only run one program at a time.

 Multitasking capabilities were then realized to make it appear as though multiple programs are running at the same time to address this problem, which initially had problems with ill-behaved processes (especially infinite loops and overwriting - see cooperative multitasking). However, preemption (kicking threads out of cores) and memory protection were introduced to resolve these problems.

More features were eventually added, leading to a prototype of a modern OS. Some of these features included:
* Multiple Users and Permissions



Personal to-do: Setup OS/161: Revisit C, Git, and GDB
