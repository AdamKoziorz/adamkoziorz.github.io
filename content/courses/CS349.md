> An introduction to contemporary user interfaces, including the basics of human-computer interaction, the user interface design/evaluation process, the event abstraction, user interface components, specification of user interfaces, and the architectures within which user interfaces are developed. Implementation and evaluation of a typical user interface is considered.

## Introduction

### Motivation

 How does an average person describe a computer? A tool that can perform different tasks. They do so using an user interface, and we wish to design effective user interfaces (UIs). Good UIs empower people to do things they could not otherwise do and create digital tools that can change the world.

Interaction is a continuous process where a user expresses their intention to a system and the system presents feedback to this user. This dynamic between the human and the computer is called Human-Computer Interaction.

In this course, we primarily focus on creating graphical user interfaces and analyzing theories and methods relevant to interface design.

### CLIs vs GUIs

#### Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)

CLIs are very flexible, efficient, and can be easily automated. However, they require a lot of memorization and as such, their usage are limited to experts. Furthermore, they are not explorable (freely navigatable).

#### Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

GUIs are explorable, easy to use, and visually impactful to users. However, they do lack the flexibility, efficiency (they take up much more computer resources than CLIs), and automation capabilities that CLIs offer.

Almost all GUIs follow the WIMP Paradigm: (W)indows, (I)cons, (M)enus, (P)ointers. Every application is isolated within its own windows that can be moved, resized, and overlapped.
