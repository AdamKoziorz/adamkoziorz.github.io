# Introduction

## Motivation

 How does an average person describe a computer? A tool that can perform different tasks. They do so using an user interface, and we wish to design effective user interfaces (UIs). Good UIs empower people to do things they could not otherwise do and create digital tools that can change the world.

Interaction is a continuous process where a user expresses their intention to a system and the system presents feedback to this user. This dynamic between the human and the computer is called Human-Computer Interaction.

In this course, we primarily focus on creating graphical user interfaces and analyzing theories and methods relevant to interface design.

## CLIs vs GUIs

### Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)

CLIs are very flexible, efficient, and can be easily automated. However, they require a lot of memorization and as such, their usage are limited to experts. Furthermore, they are not explorable (freely navigatable).

### Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

GUIs are explorable, easy to use, and visually impactful to users. However, they do lack the flexibility, efficiency (they take up much more computer resources than CLIs), and automation capabilities that CLIs offer.

Almost all GUIs follow the **WIMP** Paradigm: **W**indows, **I**cons, **M**enus, **P**ointers. Every application is isolated within its own windows that can be moved, resized, and overlapped.

</center>


## Software Stack

1. Git(Lab) - Versioning Control
2. Gradle (7.4.2+) - Build Automation Tool
3. Kotlin (1.7.21) - Our programming language of choice
4. JavaFX - A software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications
5. Java SDK (17.0.5) - Required Dependency
6. IntelliJ IDEA - our IDE of choice for developing our software

First, you should download IntelliJ then retreive the necessary dependencies by creating a project for the first time. Ensure that your version matches the versions specified here.
* We will only be concerned with modifying content within the `src` folder
* The only thing we will really use from Gradle is the `application->run` task accessible at the right tool bar in the IntelliJ IDE. You can also run these programs from the command line if you wish


## Kotlin

### Characteristics of Kotlin
1. Supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming
2. Fully interoperable with Java source and libraries
3. Multi-platform: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS
4. Kotlin's primary design objective is to shorten code
5. Automatic memory management and garbage collection

### Kotlin Usage
* Structure your code for maintenance and extendability (aka. please don't do everything in main and actually use functions and classes when appropriate)
* Opt for a functional programming paradigm whenever possible
* Emphasize short, clean code that utilizes Kotlin's offerings
* Although I will not describe Kotlin's syntax and features here, you can learn a lot more about Kotlin's features on the [course website](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/) as well as online documentation



##  GUI Stack Components

GUI applications are ultimately programs, and they may require hardware access and specific libaries. Below showcases a hierarchy of stack components required to bring a GUI application to life:

**OS Kernel** $\rightarrow$ **Window Manager** $\rightarrow$ **UI Toolkit** $\rightarrow$ **Application**

At the core is the **OS kernel**, which allows the application to interact with hardware. On top of this OS kernel is a **Window Manager** that allows the application to communicate with the OS for creating, destroying, and managing application windows (including scaling, moving, minimizing, tiling, overlapping, etc.), and routing input to the correct window. Note that each window is independent, has no knowledge of other windows, and has its own coordinate system. In short, the Windows Manager "owns" the application window while the application "owns" the content.

Lastly, a **UI Toolkit** allows us to create the content for these windows, which in turn will create our **application**. These toolkits are a set of classes for building user interfaces. They come in low-level (OS specific) and high-level (general). Some things usually offered are:

* User Interface widgets (check boxes, buttons, labels, dropdowns, etc.)
* Graphics (shapes, images, animation)
* Media playback (sound and video)
* Input handling from the mouse and keyboard
* Access to cameras, sensors, etc.

Our UI ToolKit of choice will be JavaFX. We will now learn how to utilize JavaFX through Kotlin to create effective GUIs.

 

















# Widgets, Layouts, and Events

## Scene Trees

We can break down the visual components of a GUI into scenes. A scene graph is a tree structure that arranges all the elements of a screen into a hierarchy. With such a hierarchy, we can manage dependencies and increase efficiency of our operations. Here are some important terminology:

1. The **stage** is the top-level container (`javafx.scene.Stage`) representing the entire application window
2. **Scenes** are containers that contain the content of the application (`javafx.scene.Scene`), including the scene-graph
3. **Nodes** are the displayable objects or layouts (`javafx.scene.Node`)

Sometimes, we could have changes to one node that must propagate to its children. An analogy to this is moving your elbows also moves your arms. This is why a scene tree is much more ideal over something like an array.

### Example of a Scene Tree

Consider the example code below:

```kotlin
 1.  override fun start(stage: Stage) {
 2.      val greeting = Label("Hello CS349 :-)")
 3.      val vendor   = Label(System.getProperty("java.vendor"))
 4.      val version  = Label(System.getProperty("java.version"))
 5.
 6.      val javaInfo = HBox(vendor, version).apply {
 7.            alignment = Pos.CENTER
 8.      }
 9.      val root = VBox(greeting, javaInfo).apply { 
10.            alignment = Pos.CENTER 
11.      }
12. 
13.      stage.apply {
14.          scene = Scene(root, 300.0, 200.0)
15.          title = "Hello CS349!"
16.      }.show()
17.  }
```

1. At lines `1, 13-17`, we set up the stage of the application, which includes the scenes to present and the window's title
2. At line `14`, we create a scene using a root node, which we decide will be the node created at lines `9-11` labelled `root`
3. At lines `2-11`, we create the nodes, which will be the displayed objects

The application then looks like below (excluding the red border). Here, the stage is the application window, the scene is the window content, and the nodes are the labels and their alignments. The scene tree consisting of these nodes is presented.

## Widgets

Widgets correspond to the leaves of the scene tree and are one of three key parts of an interface. Each widget has their own distinct behaviour. Examples of widgets include buttons, menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, sliders, textboxs, scrollbars, and spinners. Some primary functions of widgets are to:

1. Capture user input 
2. Generate events (send data to other parts of the program)
3. Provide user feedback (show that it's being used)
4. Maintain state (contains their own data)

When creating widgets, we should take into account consistency across other programs, workflow speed, and visual representation. Additionally, despite user interfaces being very important for interacting with software, most users do not want to see an interface but rather what they are working/playing on. We then need to take into account the real estate of the display.

Lastly, we could have multiple widgets for executing the same functionality (some programs have a "copy" menu option, "copy" button, and "copy" keyboard shortcut) to offer additional flexibility.

### Logical Inputs

There is a key subtle differences between logical inputs and widgets. Logical inputs describe underlying functionality (state and events) while widgets are visual implementations of logical inputs that could have further properties like position and size. What we think as a "button", for example, is a logical button with visual properties.

Here are examples of logical inputs:

1. **Logical Display**: Show data and provide feedback

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    Labels and images are key examples of this. They require a single text state. We could opt for low resolution (imprecise) or high resolution (precise) visualizations
    </blockquote>

2. **Logical Text Entry**: Allows users to enter text and see current state

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    Text fields and areas are key examples of this. They require text and selection states, as well as events for text change, completed entries, and selection changes
    </blockquote>

3. **Logical Button**: Perform a single interaction with one fixed action

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    Buttons and menus are key examples of this. They only require one event, which is the button click itself
    </blockquote>

4. **Logical Selection**: Allows users to visually select between states

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    There are multiple kinds of selections:

    *  Boolean (only two states - checkboxes and toggles)
    *  Discrete (multiple discrete states - radio buttons and choice boxes)
    *  Continuous (continuous states - sliders and spinners)

    They require a state to store the value chosen (a boolean, index/element, and number respectively) and an event for when the selection is changed
    </blockquote>

There are many examples of how you can create a widget based on these logical inputs using JavaFX online but due to their code length, I won't be posting them. 

### Properties and Binding

In JavaFX, a property is a special type of class member that stores a value that controls the apperance or behaviour of a widget. Some things that you can do with properties include:

1. Set them manually or programmatically
2. Attach a listener (to wait for an event)
3. Bind to a property of another class

To bind properties means to allow a property from one class to change automatically if one other property from a different class changes. There are two primary ways to do this:

1. Use a listener to directly change the property as desired
2. Use `bind()` with `Property()` methods. If we do not need to modify data, then this will be sufficient. Otherwise, we need to utilize the `Bindings` helper class



## Layout

The layout provides structure to the widgets. There are many types of layouts, and we will be concerned with dynamic layouts where the interfaces need to adjust with screen resolution and window resizing. There are two solutions to this:

1. Responsible (universal design that reflows spatial layout to fit the dimensions of the current view)
2. Adaptive (design optimized spatial layouts for each of your devices and to dynamically switch to fit devices)

We will focus on responsive layouts and how to create the scene graph using them. We have the following types of containers:

1. **Fixed Layout**: Hardcode the location and position of the nodes in the layout

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    This is best suitable for windows that are not allowed to be resized. Groups and panes allow this to occur - note that panes do not change the size of its children on the scene graph.
    </blockquote>

2. **Variable Intrinsic Layout**: Use the preferred size but queries all widgets first to allocate the appropriate space to them as a group

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    This is a good option if you want your widgets to have a preferred width and a minimum width depending on the current size of the window. You can control the behaviour of this resizing. 
    
    Notable variable intrinsic layouts include `VBox`, `HBox`, and `FlowPane`.
    </blockquote>

3. **Relative Layout**: Positioning widgets relative to other elements

    <blockquote style="border:none">
    This is a good option if you want a fixed widget and want other widgets to be responsive but maintain the same distance away from this widget.
    
    Notable relative layouts include `AnchorPane`, `BorderPane`, `TilePane` and `GridPane`. There are also `ScrollPane`, `TabPane`, and `MenuBar` which serve more so as a wrapper for other layouts.
    </blockquote>


## Events

In graphical user interfaces, users expect immediate feedback from the system to their actions. This requires us to have something that can immediately respond to user input as opposed to clocking for input. This is where event-driven programming can help us, which modern operating systems are designed to allow.

An event is a message that notify an application that something of interest has happened. Examples of events includes property events, eyboard events, pointer events, input focus events, window events, and timer events. In JavaFX, we have event classes that contain:

* EventType (type of event that occurred)
* source (node from where the event originated)
* isConsumed (whether this event has been processed)

Common event subclasses include `ActionEvent`, `MouseEvent`, `DragEvent`, `KeyEvent`, and `WindowEvent`. These provide an interface for which we need to attach a listener function to these events that process them and then whenever an event is dispatched, the relevant listener function is called for that widget. For Kotlin applications, we rely on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to queue, manage, and dispatch events.

The most basic form of event handling consists of attaching a listener function to an event, and then whenever that event is dispatched, the listener function is called for a single node. In JavaFX, this is the `EventHandler` and the usage looks something similar to this:

`scene.onMouseClicked = EventHandler { stage.title = "Clicked!" }`

With the basic way, only the single node gets notified of the event. However, there are instances where we may want its ancestors to be notified as well. This is called event dispatch, which consists of the following steps:

1. **Target selection:** Which node receives?

    - Key Event: Node that has focus (focus dispatch)
    - Mouse Event: Node at the location of the cursor (positional dispatch)
    - Touch Event: Depends on how the fingers touch

2. **Route construction:** Get the path from root to node through the scene graph
3. **Event capturing:** Traverse path from root to node and call each visited node's `filter`
4. **Event bubbling:** Traverse path from node to root and call each visited node's `handler`




 
















# UI Architecture


Consider implementing a program containing a button and a label, and you can click the button to increment the value of the label. Here's a possible implementation of this:

```kotlin
class noMVC : VBox() {
    init {
        val countLabel = Label(0.toString())
        children.addAll(
            countLabel,
            Button("Increment").apply {
                onAction = EventHandler {
                    countLabel.txt = (countLabel.text.toInt() + 1).toString()
                }
            }
        )
        alignment = Pos.CENTER
    }
}
```

With this implementation, it is very hard to expand functionality using this implementation due to its hard-coded nature. Let's look at some alternatives.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)
To greatly improve on this implementation, we can apply an architectural pattern called the **Model-View-Controller** (MVC).

<center>
<img src="/cs349-mvc.png" width="450" height="270" alt="MVC Architecture">
</center>

* **Model:** Manages system state and its modification
* **View:** Manages interface to provide feedback
* **Controller:** Manages interaction to request system state modification

Using this architecture, we can separate the front end logic and the back end logic. With this separation of concerns, we can change the view and controller without changing the underlying model, which will be useful for introducing new representations. This will lead to code reuse and easier testing.

Here is an alternative implementation using the MVC architecture:

```kotlin
// Model/model.kt
object Model : Observable {
    private var counter = 0

    fun increment() {
        ++counter
        listeners.forEach { it?.invalidated(this) }
    }

    fun getCounter() : Int {
        return counter
    }

    private val listeners = mutableListOf<InvalidationListener?>()

    override fun addListener(listener : InvalidationListener?) {
        listeners.add(listener)
    }

    override fun removeListener(listener : InvalidationListener?) {
        listeners.remove(listener)
    }
}

// Controller/controller.kt
class Controller: Button("Increment") {
    init {
        onAction = EventHandler {
            Model.increment()
        }
    }
}

// View/view.kt
class View() : Label(), InvalidationListener {
    init {
        Model.addListener(this)
        invalidate(null)
    }

    override fun invalidated(observable: Observable?) {
        text = Model.getCounter().toString()
    }
}

// app.kt
override fun start(stage: Stage) {
    val view = View()
    val control = Controller()
    stage.apply {
        title = "With MVC"
        scene = Scene(Vbox(view, control), 165.0, 100.0)
    }.show()
}
```

However, there are some practical problems and considerations with this MVC implementation (and MVC as a whole):

* Everything in the view is refreshed from the model, which is inefficient (we can solve this by listening to fields as opposed to the model)
* The view and controller can be tightly coupled in practice, and thus the separation might not make sense
* The model holds system state, but the view can have UI states (which should be separated from the model)

To listen to a field, we can use properties (ex. `SimpleDoubleProperty`). However, the usage of this will not be thoroughly discussed nor expected, and refreshing the entire view is sufficient for this course.



## Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

To overcome some of the issues with MVC, we can implement the MVVM architecture.

<center>
<img src="/cs349-mvvm.png" width="450" height="180" alt="MVVM Architecture">
</center>


* **Model:** Manages system state and its modification
* **View:** Structures the display
* **ViewModel:** Manages display logic and relegates other logic to the model




 












# Human-Computer Interaction

## Indirect and Direct Interaction

Suppose we wish to change some graphical object of interest. One possible way to do so is to indirectly manipulate the object by altering source code. While precise and lends itself to automation, it is quite difficult to know how to modify the code and there is no immediate visual feedback. You could also manually set the values using a command line interface or menus - both of which are also considered indirect manipulation because you interact with an interface as opposed to the object itself.

To directly manipulate an object means to associate physical actions with complex syntax and allow both input and feedback to occur continuously. In other words, direct manipulation means to manipulate a virtual object in a similar way to a real-world object, thus allowing manipulation without an interface. When designing an interface that allows for direct manipulation, we should divide the interface into the objects of interest (visual representation of data) and supporting tools (small widgets that allow for direct manipulation). An example of this could be to click on an image's borders to change its dimensions or rotate it.

The biggest advantage of direct manipulation is that users can better focus on their task rather than the interface, which allows for an easy-to-use, intuitive design. However, not all tasks can be invoked directly, and not all objects of interests can be easily represented using direct manipulation. Furthermore, direct manipulation can be a hinderance for visually impaired users, consume valuable screen space, and cause confusion if implemented poorly.

## Instrumental Interaction

An interaction model is a set of principles, rules, and properties that guide the design of an interface. It describes how to combine interaction techniques in a meaningful and consistent way and defines the look and feel of the interaction from the user's perspective. Properties of the interaction model can be used to evaluate specific interaction designs.

The instrumental interaction model is based on how we naturally use tools (instruments) to manipulate objects of in the physical world. With this model, interfaces have domain objects (what is being manipulated) and interaction instruments (what is manipulating the domain to get to the desired goal). To activate instruments may have spatial or time costs for spatial activation and temporal activation respectively.


To design good user interfaces, we need to take into consideration the tradeoffs of these costs. The more frequently an instrument is used, the lower its activation costs should be. Also, note that interaction instruments can themselves be domain objects.

> **Reification:** \
> Turning concepts into something concrete. The concept of "text style" is a reification of multiple concepts such as type, weight, size, algihment, spacing, and more. A meta-instrument is an instrument that acts on a reified domain object.

Imagine a customer comes to you with a problem - it's easy to create a solution, but very difficult to create a **really good** solution. You can draw them out on piece of paper, analyze time/space costs, what is to be prioritized, as well as consider the:

* Degree of indirection (offset between instrument and action)
* Degree of integration (suitability of device - degrees of freedom)
* Degree of compatability (similarity of action on device to action on object)

The ability for artists to express themselves depends on the ability to explore. Fast feedback encourages learning and understanding.


 







# Computer Graphics

## Primitives

There are three conceptual models for drawing which we call primitives: pixels, strokes (lines) and regions (shapes). JavaFX offers a canvas node that lets us draw these primitives and customize their properties using functions such as `strokeLine()`, `fillRect()`, and `drawImage()`. This canvas node contains a buffer that renders the drawing, and a drawing context that contains parameters and other information that the canvas needs to perform drawing commands.

Consider the following example below:

```kotlin
override fun start(stage: Stage) {
    val canvas = Canvas(320.0, 240.0)
    canvas.graphicsContext2D.apply {
        stroke = Color.WHITE
        fill = Color.WHITE
        fillRect(75.0, 25.0, 100.0, 100.0)
        fill = Color.AQUA
        fillRect(100.0, 50.0, 100.0, 100.0)
        fill = Color.MEDIUMPURPLE
        fillRect(125.0, 75.0, 100.0, 100.0)
    }
    stage.apply {
    scene = Scene(Group(canvas), 320.0, 240.0, Color.BLACK)
    title = "Hello CS349!"
    }.show()
}
```

There is stack-like behaviour at play here - each time a function is used to draw something, that function will apply the properties stored in the context before it is called and draw the corresponding primitive on top of everything else that has been drawn on the canvas. To hold specific properties that will be used later, we can `save()` the current properties of the states and then `restore()` when we wish to use those properties again. Below is what the above code produces:

<center>

</center>

Observe that complex drawings are simply combined primitives drawn back-to-front. Drawing complex shapes in this way is called the painter's algorithm:

## Transformations

### Graphic Models

Computer Graphics are ultimately the creation, storage, and manipulation of images and their models, which is the mathematical representations of an image and contains important properties of an object in data structures.

An array of points $\\\{P_1, P_2, ... , P_n\\\}$ defines a shape and contains properties (ie. `isClosed`, `isFilled`, `thickness`, etc.) that determine how it is drawn. These points are defined relative to a base coordinate system and are subject to transformations, which include translation, rotations, and scaling:

Whenever we perform a transformation, we need to transform the model to get another model $(x'_i, y'_i = f(x_i, y_i))$, and this new model will be rendered. We can represent each transformation mathematically as such.

### Transformation Basics

* **Translation:** Add the same vector $t$ to each vertex $v$

<center>
<img src="/cs349-translation.png" width="500" height="200" alt="Translation">
</center>

$$v' : \begin{cases}
    x' = x + t_x \\\\
    y' = y + t_y
    \end{cases} $$

* **Scaling:** Multiply each $v_x$ by $s_x$ and each $v_y$ by $s_y$

<center>
<img src="/cs349-scaling.png" width="500" height="200" alt="Scaling">
</center>

$$v' : \begin{cases}
    x' = x \times s_x \\\\
    y' = y \times s_y
    \end{cases} $$


* **Rotation:** Rotate each vertex $v$ around the origin by $\theta$ degrees

<center>
<img src="/cs349-rotation.png" width="500" height="200" alt="Rotation">
</center>

$$v' : \begin{cases}
    x' = x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta \\\\
    y' = x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta
    \end{cases} $$
