Since I have only recently started the construction of this site as well as type up course notes for public usage, I do not have any well-written course notes for my first and second year courses. My current focus is on my current courses as well as gaining experience through co-ops and personal practice.

That being said, I would like to dedicate some time to summarizing some of the courses that I have taken in the past just incase I need to refer to its content. I also wish to showcase the courses that I have taken and what I have personally got from them.

## Year One CS/MATH

#### CS136 - Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction

#### Other Classes (no notes)

Unfortunately, CS136 was the only first year CS/MATH class that I have taken notes for. The other courses I have taken, but do not have notes for, include:
- CS135 (Designing Functional Programs)
- MATH135 (Algebra)
- MATH136 (Linear Algebra)
- MATH137 (Calculus 1)
- MATH138 (Calculus 2)

These first year math courses exposed me to many essential and interesting topics, and I was able to strengthen both my calculation and proof skills in them.
## Year Two CS/MATH

#### CS240 - Data Structures and Data Management

#### CS241 - Foundations of Sequential Programming

#### MATH239 - Introduction to Combinatorics

#### STAT230 - Probability

#### Other Classes (no notes)

The second year CS/MATH courses that I have taken, but do not have notes for, include:
- CS245 (Logic and Computation)
- CS246 (Object-Oriented Software Development)
- CS251 (Computer Organization and Design).

With these courses, I was able to explore the field of computer science further, both theoretical and practical. CS251 taught me how computers work at a very low level, and its knowledge will be useful for CS350 (Operating Systems)
