Since I have only recently started the construction of this site as well as type up course notes for public usage, I do not have any well-written course notes for my first and second year courses. My current focus is on my current courses as well as gaining experience through co-ops and personal practice.

That being said, I would like to dedicate some time to summarizing some of the courses that I have taken in the past just incase I need to refer to its content. I also wish to showcase the courses that I have taken and what I have personally got from them.

## Year One CS/MATH

In my first year of computer science, I took the following courses:
- CS135 (Designing Functional Programs)
- CS136 (Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction)
- MATH135 (Algebra)
- MATH136 (Linear Algebra)
- MATH137 (Calculus 1)
- MATH138 (Calculus 2)

CS135 and CS136 were my first true experiences with programming. With programming languages that were unfamiliar to me (Racket and C), I explored many new concepts and data structures through many programming exercises. Of particular interest to me was the concept of abstract data types and how they could be realized in many different ways like binary search trees, queues, and stacks - each one of them having their own tradeoffs.

My first year math courses exposed me to many essential and interesting topics, and I was able to strengthen both my calculation and proof skills in them.


## Year Two CS/MATH

In my second year of computer science, I took the following courses:
- CS240 (Data Structures and Data Management)
- CS241 (Foundations of Sequential Programming)
- CS245 (Logic and Computation)
- CS246 (Object-Oriented Software Development)
- CS251 (Computer Organization and Design)
- MATH239 (Introduction to Combinatorics)
- STAT230 (Probability)

With these courses, I was able to explore many unfamiliar subfields of computer science and math further, both theoretical and practical. With CS241 and CS251, I finally received an understanding of how computers work at a lower level and how they "understand" programming languages, which has always been a mystery to me. MATH239 was also very interesting and I can imagine that the content on Graph Theory will be of high usage in my future courses and projects, especially CS341.

## Electives

Though I am persuing a Computer Science degree, I have a very deep interest in music and have taken two courses in music so far. As both as an avid listener and composer, I appreciate the beauty of music and recognize how powerfully it controls our well-being and identity. I am actively looking for possible projects that intersects music with software, and I do have a relatively large side project in the works.

In addition to Music courses, I have also taken courses in Human Resources, Professional Development and Digital Communication - all of which will help me navigate through the workforce with awareness of how the software I develop, as well as how that software is developed, can affect people.

## Notes

I do have some rough notes for the following courses:
- CS136
- CS240
- CS241
- MAT239
- STAT230
