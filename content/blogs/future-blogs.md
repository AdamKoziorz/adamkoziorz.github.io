Here are some topics that I find would be interesting to write about:

* Analyzing ChatGPT from an XAI perspective
* How can AI solutions responsibly transform human expression
* Bridging the gap between designers and developers
* My personal journey at UWaterloo

I hope to tackle each of these topics in the future as time permits with studies!
