I'm Adam Koziorz, and I am a 3rd year Computer Science Co-op student at the University of Waterloo! There are many personal experiences and interests of mine that have shaped my current path, and I would like to share to you those experiences and what that path might look like in the future.


### Adam.ComputerScience()

Truthfully, I am a little bit of a late bloomer when it comes to Computer Science as a whole. I had many interests throughout my time in elementary school and high school, and I struggled to settle on a degree to persue, let alone focus on one specific interest.

I considered degrees in Applied Math, Engineering Science, Physics, Architecture, Medicine, Teaching, and Music. However, I ultimately chose to persue a degree in Computer Science despite never programming anything larger than a basic calculator at the time.

It seemed like a strange choice, but the more exposure I get to computer science through my classes and co-op, the more I am confident that this was actually a very good choice. Computer Science is a very broad field, and almost every industry and hobby nowadays utilizes software to some capacity. It's with computer science that I can utilize my skills with math and computers, and use that knowledge to develop software that aligns with some of my other interests.

Even more recently, I've developed interest in Human-Computer Interaction. I already enjoy learning about computers, but understanding how users are affected by our decisions brings a new dimension to computer science that not only intrigues me but empowers me.

I intend to specialize in Human-Computer Interaction and currently expect to graduate sometime in 2025.


### Adam.Music()
My taste in music is pretty strange, with my two favourite music genres being bass music (dubstep, electro, house, etc.) and synthwave. I also listen to dozens of other genres like classical, ambient, and lofi.

Here are some of my current favourites tracks:
