### Humans and Computers as Partners

Not too long ago, I finished reading Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things" which helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to design better products as well as challenges that designers might face in the industry. Although the entire book was full of useful information that will help me become a better UX designer, there were two quotes that stood out to me the most:

> "Humans are strongest exactly where computers are weak, creating a potentially beautiful partnership"

> "Our technologies may change, but the fundamental principles of interaction are permanent"

Humans are creative, exploratory, and social beings. Those traits, unfortunately, make precise, dull tasks difficult for humans to perform. Thankfully, computers (up until now) are exactly that and performs such tasks with zero issue - a great partnership!

However, with the rise of modern AI technologies, computers have become more "human". They are no longer the precise, dull machines they once were, and people have begun replacing other people with them. I find this deeply troubling for many reasons like increased unemployment and a lack of accountability, but none are as more personally troubling than the erosion of our humanity. Regardless, AI is certainly here to stay due to its potential applications, and we must learn to work with it rather than against it.


### Design Considerations

Despite AI systems exhibiting human-like abilities, we must design them in such a way that they work with us rather than replace us. Thankfully, many design principles can still be applied to the design of AI solutions, but there are extra considerations, more specifically:

* Non-technical users should be able to understand why the AI system produced output the way it did
* Developers should be able to easily audit data, models, and outputs to address sources of error and uncertainty
* Data models must be secure from adversaries and completely free from biases

Hopefully in the future, I am able to gain some practical experience in designing responsible AI systems that consider the above.
