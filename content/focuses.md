### UX Design

I have taken courses in user interfaces, human-centered design, and cognitive psychology. Right now, I am currently diving into more research regarding UX design. 

As an aspiring UX designer, I find it especially important and engaging for me to:

* Design with human behaviour and limitations in mind
* Foster feelings of empowerment and self-control
* Communicate complex implementation info and outputs in understandable ways



### Human-Centered AI Systems

I will soon be taking courses in machine learning and ethics with the goal of being able to understand both the implementation and implications of modern AI technologies. 

I am particularly interested in the design of responsible AI systems that:

* Augment human abilities rather than displace them
* Promote collaboration, self-improvement, and trust with the humans that use it
* Avoid harmful biases and addresses data-related concerns


### Data Science

* I have previously worked as a data scientist, and I was responsible for developing an improved BI reporting architecture and DevOps practices that eventually enabled the efficient development of automatically refreshed, intuitive dashboards
* In the future, I will be taking courses in data privacy and security, databases, and data intensive distributed computing
* I am interested in how we can effectively work with user data in an ethical manner, especially from a privacy standpoint

### Project Management

* While I previously worked as a data scientist, I also took on project management responsibilities, effectively coordinating communication between stakeholders and ensuring the timely completion of the high quality dashboards my team was responsible for
* I realized the importance of clear communication and documentation, and developed an understanding of how stakeholders in different teams interact with each other
* I wish to be in a role where I am able to make an impact on my team and nurture a collaborative, inclusive environment

### Web Development

* I am also a self-taught web developer working through the Odin Project curriculum, and I am currently doing the section on React
* You can see some of my small projects <a href="https://adamkoziorz.github.io/odin-dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>, if you are interested - maybe I will work on more complex, useful web apps in the future
* I think that being able to develop websites and web apps is a good skill to have even as somebody more focused on UX design
